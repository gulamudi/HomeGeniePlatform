# Admin App Fixes Summary

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 1. Phone Number Format Consistency
**Files Modified:**
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/partners/screens/partner_edit_screen.dart:47-55`
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/customers/screens/customer_edit_screen.dart:47-55`

**Changes:**
- Added logic to ensure +91 prefix is consistently added to phone numbers
- Handles cases where user enters: `91XXXXXXXXXX`, `XXXXXXXXXX`, or `+91XXXXXXXXXX`
- Normalizes all to `+91XXXXXXXXXX` format before saving

### 2. Database Foreign Key Constraint Fix
**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20241014000008_fix_admin_trigger_conflict.sql` (created)

**Changes:**
- Identified root cause: `on_auth_user_created` trigger was automatically creating `public.users` and profile records
- Admin functions were trying to insert the same records, causing duplicate key violations
- Solution: Let the trigger handle user/profile creation, then update with admin-specific fields
- Result: No more duplicate key errors when creating users

### 3. Ambiguous Relationship Errors Fixed
**Files Modified:**
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/core/network/admin_api_service.dart`

**Changes:**
- Specified exact foreign key relationships in PostgREST queries:
  - `partner_profiles!partner_profiles_user_id_fkey`
  - `customer_profiles!customer_profiles_user_id_fkey`
- Fixes "Could not embed because more than one relationship was found" errors

### 4. Auto-Refresh on Page Navigation
**Files Modified:**
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/dashboard/providers/dashboard_stats_provider.dart:5`
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/partners/providers/partners_provider.dart:4-10`
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/customers/providers/customers_provider.dart:4-10`

**Changes:**
- Changed all providers from `FutureProvider` to `FutureProvider.autoDispose`
- Ensures data refreshes automatically when navigating to pages

### 5. Pull-to-Refresh Implemented
**Files Modified:**
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/dashboard/screens/admin_dashboard_screen.dart:31-35`
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/partners/screens/partner_list_screen.dart:137-141`
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/customers/screens/customer_list_screen.dart:109-113`

**Changes:**
- Added `RefreshIndicator` wrapping list views
- Invalidates providers on refresh to fetch fresh data
- Provides better UX for manual data refresh

### 6. Email Field Removed
**Files Modified:**
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/partners/screens/partner_edit_screen.dart`
- `homegenie_admin_app/lib/features/customers/screens/customer_edit_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Removed email text field from both partner and customer creation forms
- Set email parameter to `null` in API calls

## ⏳ Remaining Issues (Requires Additional Work)

### 1. "Initiate New Booking" Button (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location:** `customer_edit_screen.dart:227-244`
**Issue:** Button does nothing
**Solution Needed:**
- Create a booking creation screen or dialog
- Pre-populate with customer information
- Navigate to booking flow with customer ID

**Suggested Fix:**
```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Navigate to booking creation with pre-filled customer
    context.push('/bookings/create', extra: {'customerId': widget.customerId});
  },
  child: const Text('Initiate New Booking for This User'),
)
```

### 2. Partner Verification Controls (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location:** `partner_edit_screen.dart`
**Issue:** No way to verify/reject partners from admin app
**Solution Needed:**
- Add verification status dropdown showing current status
- Add "Approve" and "Reject" buttons
- Call API endpoint to update `partner_profiles.verification_status`
- Show verification history/notes

**Database Fields:**
- `partner_profiles.verification_status` (already exists: 'pending', 'verified', 'rejected')

### 3. Partner Assignment in Bookings (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location:** `assign_partner_screen.dart`
**Issue:** No partners showing when clicking "View All Partners"
**Investigation Needed:**
- Check if `getAvailablePartners()` API is being called
- Debug the query and response
- Check if partners exist with `verification_status = 'verified'`
- Ensure proper UI rendering

**Quick Test:**
```sql
-- Check if verified partners exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM partner_profiles WHERE verification_status = 'verified';
```

### 4. Filter Chips (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Location:** `partner_list_screen.dart:93-98`
**Issue:** Filter chips are placeholders with no functionality
**Solution Needed:**
- Implement dropdown/dialog for each filter:
  - Service Type: Multi-select from available services
  - Verification: verified/pending/rejected
  - Availability: available/busy/offline
- Update provider to accept filter parameters
- Modify API call to filter results

### 5. Edit Preferences Button (LOW PRIORITY)
**Location:** `partner_edit_screen.dart:221-234`
**Issue:** Placeholder button
**Solution Needed:**
- Create service selection screen/dialog
- Allow multi-select of services from `services` table
- Update `partner_profiles.services` array
- Could reuse components from partner app

### 6. Manage Availability Button (LOW PRIORITY)
**Location:** `partner_edit_screen.dart:260-275`
**Issue:** Placeholder button
**Solution Needed:**
- Create availability management screen
- Allow setting weekly schedules
- Save to `partner_availability` table
- Could reuse components from partner app

### 7. View/Manage Documents Button (LOW PRIORITY)
**Location:** `partner_edit_screen.dart:346-361`
**Issue:** Placeholder button
**Solution Needed:**
- Create document management screen
- List uploaded documents with status
- Allow viewing/downloading documents
- Allow approving/rejecting documents
- Update verification status based on documents

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create partner with phone number (test +91 prefix)
- [ ] Create customer with phone number (test +91 prefix)
- [ ] Partner should be able to login from partner app
- [ ] Customer should be able to login from customer app
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh works on all list screens
- [ ] Navigation between screens refreshes data
- [ ] Search functionality works on partners/customers
- [ ] Partner verification workflow (once implemented)
- [ ] Booking assignment workflow (once fixed)

## Architecture Notes

The admin app uses:
- **Riverpod** for state management
- **GoRouter** for navigation
- **Supabase** for backend (PostgREST + Auth)
- **FutureProvider.autoDispose** for auto-refreshing data

All API calls go through `admin_api_service.dart` which uses the Supabase client.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix partner assignment in bookings** - This is blocking core admin functionality
2. **Add partner verification controls** - Critical for partner onboarding flow
3. **Implement booking creation from customer screen** - Useful admin feature
4. **Add working filters** - Nice-to-have UX improvement
5. **Implement preferences/availability/documents** - Can be done incrementally
